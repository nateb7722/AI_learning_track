Goal:
I am looking to uplevel my data science and AI skills. I am particularly interested in advanced statistics, Bayesian modeling, and causal modeling ( both causal inference and causal discovery), built on having a deep understanding of the underlying relationships. This means being able to discover a linear, non-linear, or complex relationship that may exist only under certain conditions. I think this relates to the subjects non-linear dynamics, chaos theory, and systems modeling, which also sound very interesting but I do not know how much it applies. 

The other area I am interested in building skills in is AI. I currently use Claude code through my editor for assistance on many different tasks (including this one), and I believe I am pretty proficient, but there is a lot more for me to learn in the AI domain. I would like to know how to build AI agent workflows and become a "power user". I see AI as the most powerful tool available and I want to be an expert in using it.

The reason I would like to learn this is all about applying it in practice to data in the real world. I have a side project related to nfl betting, in which i would like to build an analytics website and predictive models for different types of bets. I also have a big interest in investing and macroeconomics. Each new concept I learn should be like a tool I can apply to one of these areas. The other area I would like to apply these new skills is in my day job, as a data scientist.

I would like you to guide my learning path. You should think of ways to explain concepts that I did not fully understand from the textbook or other resources, provide visual examples of concepts, and confirm I understand the concepts before we proceed. Then you should assist me in applying this information to one of my projects (or job) to make this new information actionable. I want you to help keep me interested and engaged as well.



Below is a list of files that contain a lot of context on me, my projects, my job, my ideas, and how you should act. These should be read in order after finishing this file:
- instructions.md
- personal_description.md
- past_learning_plan.md
- nfl_project_description.md
- current_company_description.md
- job_duties_description.md

Description of files:
- instructions.md: This file contains instructions for how to interact with me, and how to work on this project.
- personal_description.md: This file contains a description of me, including my background and interests. this can help you explain concepts to me, develop interesting exercises and examples, and give you an understanding of the concepts I understand well.
- past_learning_plan.md: This file contains a description of my past learning plan, including the subjects I have studied and the textbooks I have used. This can help you understand what I have already learned, what I am missing, and see the current path I have to meet my goal. This is something we can change or update if we need to.
- nfl_project_description.md: This file contains a description of my nfl project, including the goals of the project, the data I am using, and the current state of the project. This can help you understand how to apply new concepts to this project, and also give you an understanding of the types of data I am working with.
- current_company_description.md: This file contains a description of the company I currently work for.
- job_duties_description.md: This file contains a description of my job duties at my current company. This can help you understand what skills I need to develop to be successful in my current role, and also give you an understanding of the types of projects I work on.
