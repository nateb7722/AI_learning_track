I am currently a Data Scientist with almost 7 years of work experience since I graduated college. I originally went to the University of Kansas and was majoring in Economics, but then lived abroad for 3 years before moving back and finishing my degree at Depaul University. While living abroad I became very interested in macroeconomics and investing. I read books like “The Intelligent Investor”, “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits”, “The Essays of Warren Buffett”, “A Random Walk Down Wall Street”, and I especially liked books like “The Accidental Superpower”, “Intermarket Analysis”, and anything by Jim Rogers, among others. 

Here are some investors who I like to read from or listen to:
- Mike Green
- Brent Johnson
- Lyn Alden
- Luke Gromen
- Jim Bianco
- Grant Williams
- Cem Karsen
- Darius Dale
- Stanley Druckenmiller
- Ray Dalio
- Howard Marks


I wanted to get into trading, so when I went back to college to finish my economics degree, I minored in Data Science. I ended up getting my first job doing data analysis for class action lawsuits, doing mostly basic analysis using SAS. 

After 2 years of that, I got a job as a data analyst at my current company. You can read about my time there in the job_duties_descrtiption file.

I really like reading about physics, math, and statistics subjects as well. Anything about space, UAP's, new ways of travel or new possible technologies are very interesting to me. I am always interested to read about some physics or math concepts that get applied to my area of expertise. The root of my passion comes down to trying to break down complex systems or behavior that seems random or chaotic, but can somehow be predicted (even if not 100% accurate).
