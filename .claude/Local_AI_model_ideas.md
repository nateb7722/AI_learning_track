Investing:
- Idea 1:
  - higher level model that assesses macroeconomic backdrop and how current conditions differ from overall long-term thesis
  - Model that assesses the overall long-term thesis and searches for recommended changes. Is the long-term thesis proving incorrect?
  - model that determines short term macroeconomic outlook given current conditions and long-term thesis
  - local model that finds list of tickers that fit short term outlook and long-term thesis
  - local model that finds list of tickers that fit long-term thesis regardless of short-term
  - local model that analyzes the fundamentals of a given ticker (debt, cash flow, revenue, profit, growth, etc)
  - local model that analyzes the technicals of a given ticker (open interest, implied volatility, volume, momentum, etc.)
  - model that compiles this information and relays it to me


Experimentation at work:
- Idea 1:
- model that takes company context, experiment purpose, best practices documentation, and examples, and recommends a hypothesis, metrics, and experiment design for a given experiment
- model that takes hypothesis, metrics and experiment design as input and creates them using sql
- model that runs power analysis given best practices and example power analyses.
- model that takes metrics, experiment, company context, and past analyses to identify important covariates that could become confounders in experiment
- model that takes experiment results and covariate analysis and develops multilevel model (if-needed)
- model that runs safety checks on experiment (users only receiving one variant, SRM checks, etc)
