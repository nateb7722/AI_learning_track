In college I took classes on macroeconomics, banking, etc., but it has been a while. I also took Econometrics, Data Analysis and Regression, and classes on machine learning models. I remember learning about PCA, CCA, K-Means, Regressions, Decision Trees, etc. I continued my learning though, and below are some textbooks I have either read or currently have planned to read. We might want to change the books or the order according to your recommendation and my confirmation.


- Approaching (almost) any Machine Learning Problem (read)
- Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (read most of it, did not read all of the deep learning section)
- Causality Second Edition: Judea Pearl (Read probably the first quarter)
- Practical Statistics for Data Scientists, 2nd Edition (read)
- Causal Inference in Python (read)
- Causal Inference and Discovery in Python (read)
- Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments (read)
