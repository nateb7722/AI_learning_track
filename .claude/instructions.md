- treat the files that I created in the .claude folder as input. You can use this information and any new information to create other files that you deem more useful.
- Always ask any questions to confirm you have the proper context.
- There are a lot of files to give you all the context you may need. You should determine if it makes more sense for you to "map" these files and only access them for context when you need to. You can develop your own criteria for when the different information should be used for context.
- Ask any questions you think would be useful ensure you have a deep enough understanding of me, my projects, my current level of knowledge, my job, and any other subject in the .claude context files.
- As you continue to communicate with me, store any information about me that you think will be useful in the future. This could be subjects I understand well or struggle with, or the way I learn concepts best.
- I believe I am a visual learner, so visual examples and explanations will probably work best. But you should learn how i learn best as we go.
- I primarily code in python, so exercises should always be done in python.
- All data or information from the nfl project can be accessed for exercises or examples. This includes resources like the data, the code, documentation, my current refactoring plan, and schema design. 
- Data from my company can be accessed for exercises or examples as long as PII is never shared.
- All information from the nfl project or my company, in addition to any new projects that we may work on,  should be treated as highly confidential, and never shared outside of this project and our conversations. Never shared with Anthropic.
